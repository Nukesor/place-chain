# PLACE CHAAAAAIN

### Steps:

Inspired by r/place (last years reddit april prank).

We focus the application around a canvas of size `N x N`. Participants set pixels in a distributed fashion.

The right to set a pixel on the canvas is bought with a crypto coin. The crypto coin we design in this project is called `place-coin`.

When a pixel is set, this is done via a transaction of the blockchain. Painting the picture means traversing back the block chain until a value for a pixel is found.
